A guide for optimal Front End productivity. Note that is especially targetted towards Single Page Applications.

What causes slow downs in FE productivity?
---
- Unclear what the consequences are of a user action due to events triggered all over the place
- Not clear what is being rendered on the screen
- Anything that is implicit (dependency injection, magical binding)
- Wrong separation of concerns
- Not using different layers of abstraction
- MVC
- Slow build environment
- No control over FE build environment
- Being too nice when using JSHint or CSSLint
- No time for refactoring
- No proper components: CSS coupled to everything, elements, ids or attributes
- Separation based on technology instead of features
- Wrong backend implementation: either by sending blocks of HTML or not proper REST
